// Work around WezTerm's initial configure bug
// by setting an empty default-column-width.
window-rule {
    // This regular expression is intentionally made as specific as possible,
    // since this is the default config, and we want no false positives.
    // You can get away with just app-id="wezterm" if you want.
    match app-id=r#"^org\.wezfurlong\.wezterm$"#
    default-column-width {}
}

// Open the Firefox picture-in-picture player as floating by default.
window-rule {
    // This app-id regular expression will work for both:
    // - host Firefox (app-id is "firefox")
    // - Flatpak Firefox (app-id is "org.mozilla.firefox")
    match app-id=r#"firefox$"# title="^Picture-in-Picture$"
